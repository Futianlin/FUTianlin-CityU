My name is Fu Tianlin. I will pursue my MSc in Business Information Systems (Financial and Intelligent Technology Stream) at the City University of Hong Kong and will graduate in July 2026. Hope you are interested in taking me as your doctoral student in fall 2026.
 
My academic and research background ranges from software engineering, finance, to applied AI. During my undergraduate studies, I engaged in various research projects, including: developing the RSIDR benchmark dataset for single-image dedusting, publishing on EEG denoising using Kalman filter techniques and privacy-preserving encryption for electronic health records, and leading a project on 3D scene reconstruction using the GIRAFFE framework. These experiences have equipped me with strong technical skills (Python, Java, PyTorch, Vue.js), research communication abilities, and a passion for solving real-world problems through intelligent systems and data-driven methods.
